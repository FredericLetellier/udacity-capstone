#Project 7: Capstone

In the Capstone project, you will build an app of your own design in two stages.

#Project 7: Capstone, Stage 1 - Design

In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide 
in the "Instructions" node.

Creating and building your own app idea can be both exciting and daunting; 
ultimately, we want the experience to be rewarding. You'll apply a wealth 
of different concepts and components that you've learned across the Nanodegree 
to bring you own app idea to life.

To keep the process from becoming overwhelming (or simply chaotic), you will 
design and plan your app, and receive feedback, before you start building. 
This will help prevent and mitigate pain points you might run into along the 
way, and also replicates the process of professional Android Developers.

##Why this Project

To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make 
plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you 
will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality 
to include in the app.

##What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app 
idea formally, using:

* An app description
* UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like 
the Popular Movies overview 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true
* A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order


The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full 
development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning 
experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.
