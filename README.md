#Project 7: Capstone

In the Capstone project, you will build an app of your own design in two stages.

#Capstone, Stage 1 - Design

In Stage 1, you will design and plan the app, using a template that we provide 
in the "Instructions" node.

Creating and building your own app idea can be both exciting and daunting; 
ultimately, we want the experience to be rewarding. You'll apply a wealth 
of different concepts and components that you've learned across the Nanodegree 
to bring you own app idea to life.

To keep the process from becoming overwhelming (or simply chaotic), you will 
design and plan your app, and receive feedback, before you start building. 
This will help prevent and mitigate pain points you might run into along the 
way, and also replicates the process of professional Android Developers.

##Why this Project

To become a proficient Android Developer, you need to design apps and make 
plans for how to implement them. This will involve choices such as how you 
will store data, how you will display data to the user, and what functionality 
to include in the app.

##What Will I Learn?

Through this project, you'll demonstrate the ability to communicate an app 
idea formally, using:

* An app description
* UI flow mocks, similar to what you've seen in other Nanodegree projects, like 
the [Popular Movies overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlN1fUsCSKuInLECcJkslIqvpKlP7jWL2TP9m6UiA6I/pub?embedded=true)
* A list of required tasks that you will complete to build the app, in order


The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full 
development of an app. This first stage replicates the design and planning 
experience that proficient Android Developers are expected to demonstrate.

* App design specification demonstrates implementing all features required 
for [Project 8: Capstone, Stage 2 - Build](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/65/view).


#Capstone, Stage 2 - Build

In Stage 1, you designed and planned your Capstone app. Now, it's time to 
build it!

**Nanodegree students must successfully complete the [Capstone, Stage 1](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd801/parts/80113454017/modules/404121860775460/lessons/4041218607239847/concepts/42808888650923) 
project prior to beginning Stage 2.**

##Why this Project

In this project, you will demonstrate the skills you've learned in your Nanodegree 
journey, and apply them to creating a unique app experience of your own. By the 
end of this project, you will have an app that you can submit to the Google 
Play Store for distribution.

##What Will I Learn?

The Capstone project will give you the experience you need to own the full 
development cycle of an app..

# Rubric

### Common Project Requirements

* App conforms to common standards found in the 
[Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html)


### Core Platform Development

* App integrates a third-party library.
* App validates all input from servers and users. If data does not exist 
or is in the wrong format, the app logs this fact and does not crash.
* App includes support for accessibility. That includes content descriptions, 
navigation using a D-pad, and, if applicable, non-audio versions of audio cues.
* App keeps all strings in a **strings.xml** file and enables RTL layout switching 
on all layouts.
* App provides a widget to provide relevant information to the user on the 
home screen.


### Google Play Services

* App integrates two or more Google services. Google service integrations 
can be a part of Google Play Services or Firebase.
* Each service imported in the **build.gradle** is used in the app.
* If **Location** is used, the app customizes the user’s experience by using 
the device's location.
* If **Admob** is used, the app displays test ads. If **Admob** was not used, student 
meets specifications.
* If **Analytics** is used, the app creates only one analytics instance. If **Analytics** 
was not used, student meets specifications.
* If **Maps** is used, the map provides relevant information to the user. If **Maps** 
was not used, student meets specifications.
* If **Identity** is used, the user’s identity influences some portion of the app. 
If **Identity** was not used, student meets specifications.


### Material Design

* App theme extends **AppCompat**.
* App uses an app bar and associated toolbars.
* App uses standard and simple transitions between activities.


### Building

* App builds from a clean repository checkout with no additional configuration.
* App builds and deploys using the **installRelease** **Gradle** task.
* App is equipped with a signing configuration, and the keystore and passwords 
are included in the repository. Keystore is referred to by a relative path.
* All app dependencies are managed by **Gradle**.


### Data Persistence

* App implements a **ContentProvider** to access locally stored data.
* Must implement at least **one** of the three :
If it regularly pulls or sends data to/from a web service or API, app updates 
data in its cache at regular intervals using a **SyncAdapter**.
OR
If it needs to pull or send data to/from a web service or API only once, 
or on a per request basis (such as a search application), app uses an **IntentService** 
to do so.
OR
It it performs short duration, on-demand requests (such as search), app uses 
an **AsyncTask**.
* App uses a **Loader** to move its data to its views.


### Suggestions to Make Your Project Stand Out!

* Make your app more delightful with material design patterns such as **shared 
element transitions** across activities and **parallax scrolling** where two or more 
items must scroll in the same activity.
* Implement **notifications** in your app. Remember the following when implementing notifications:
-Notifications should not contain advertising or content unrelated to the core function of the app.
-Notifications should be persistent only if related to ongoing events (such as music playback or a phone call).
-Multiple notifications are stacked into a single notification object, where possible.
-Use notifications only to indicate a context change relating to the user personally (such as an incoming message).
-Use notifications only to expose information/controls relating to an ongoing event (such as music playback or a phone call).
* Implement **sharing** functionality in your app, making use of intent extras 
to share rich content (i.e. a paragraph of content-specific text, a link and 
description, an image, etc).
* Create and use a **custom view** in your app that could not be achieved with 
the standard widgets provided by the core views on Android.
