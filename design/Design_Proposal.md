##Description <a name="description"></a>

**Food Inspector, Choose well to eat better**

Examine the real nutritional value of your favorite food, and discover healthier 
similar products for you and your family.

You like choose good products but you are unable to decipher the label? 
No time to examine for when you go shopping?

With the food inspector, by scanning the product barcode, you get in one 
click a product's nutritional score for what you hold in your hands. And 
above all, you get a list of similar products with a better nutritional 
score.

Whence comes this nutritional score? This is a system of ratings from A to E
 to afford to simply compare the nutritional quality of products. It has 
 been defined by Professor Serge Hercberg in the work of the Research Team 
 on Nutritional Epidemiology (EREN) from Université Paris 13 / Avicenne Hospital. 
 These colors grade are set by calculating a nutritional quality score that 
 reflects a part of the energy, saturated fat, sugars, sodium (high levels 
 are considered unhealthy), and secondly the proportion of fruits, vegetables 
 and nuts, fiber and protein (high levels are considered good for health).

Where do the data used for the calculation? Open Food Facts Project, a nonprofit 
citizen project, created by thousands of volunteers around the world, to list 
the ingredients, allergens, nutritional composition and all the information 
on food labels.

So what are you waiting to judge the nutritional quality of food products 
that fill your closets?

##Intended User <a name="intended-user"></a>

People who buy food product, who want to take care to eat well, who want 
more transparency about food product, who want a fast solution to compare
food products.                      
 
##Features <a name="features"></a>

List the main features of your app.
•	Scan a barcode of a food product
•	Obtain details about this product
•	Obtain the nutrition grade of this product
•	Obtain the list of product in the same categorie with better nutrition grade
•	Explore the history of view and scan products
•	Mark a product as favorite

##User Interface Mocks <a name="user-interface-mocks"></a>
These can be created by hand (take a photo of your drawings and insert them in this flow), or using a program like Photoshop or Balsamiq.

###Screen 1 <a name="screen-1"></a>
 
Replace the above image with your own mock [ click on the above image, then navigate to Insert → Image… ]
Provide descriptive text for each screen 


###Screen 2 <a name="screen-2"></a>
 
Replace the above image with your own mock [ click on the above image, then navigate to Insert → Image… ]
Provide descriptive text for each screen 

Add as many screens as you need to portray your app’s UI flow. 

##Key Considerations <a name="key-considerations"></a>

How will your app handle data persistence? 

Describe how your app with handle data. (For example, will you build a Content Provider or connect to an existing one?)

Describe any corner cases in the UX.

For example, how does the user return to a Now Playing screen in a media player if they hit the back button?

Describe any libraries you’ll be using and share your reasoning for including them.

For example, Picasso or Glide to handle the loading and caching of images. 

Describe how you will implement Google Play Services.

Describe which Google Play Services you will use and how.



##Next Steps: Required Tasks <a name="next-steps-required-tasks"></a>

This is the section where you can take the main features of your app (declared above) and decompose them into tangible technical tasks that you can complete incrementally until you have a finished app.

###Task 1: Project Setup <a name="task-1-project-setup"></a>

Write out the steps you will take to setup and/or configure this project. See previous implementation guides for an example. 

You may want to list the subtasks. For example:
* Configure libraries 
* Something else 

If it helps, imagine you are describing these tasks to a friend who wants to follow along and build this app with you. 

###Task 2: Implement UI for Each Activity and Fragment <a name=""></a>

List the subtasks. For example:
* Build UI for MainActivity
* Build UI for something else  

###Task 3: Your Next Task <a name=""></a>

Describe the next task. For example, “Implement Google Play Services,” or “Handle Error Cases,” or “Create Build Variant.”

Describe the next task. List the subtasks. For example:
* Create layout 
* Something else 


###Task 4: Your Next Task <a name=""></a>

Describe the next task. List the subtasks. For example:
* Create layout 
* Something else 


###Task 5: Your Next Task <a name=""></a>

Describe the next task. List the subtasks. For example:
* Create layout 
* Something else
